# InterstellarJS
A place for the collection of my 3D creation endeavors. This stems from my PlanetTech project. The more I kept creating, the more I realized different products emerged from it. So, I separated things into different code bases that can be used in various projects and placed them all under the InterstellarJS organization. I intend to make each projects public when they reach an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage.
